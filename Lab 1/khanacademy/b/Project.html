  Why does everyone <strong><em> love </em> Madrid </strong>?<br>
  <strong> Madrid is the capital of Spain and is its largest city. It is very cosmopolitan and sophisticated, and full of very educated people.</strong> <br>
  This could not but affect the architecture of the city. The fountains of Madrid are unforgettable because of their beautiful designs. Foremost among them is the Fountain of Cibeles, which represents Madrid. There are also the Fountain of Neptune and the Fountain of Apollo. Football teams and their supporters go to these fountains to celebrate their victories - that's what this city is loved for! </p>

    <li  class="places"> <strong>Prado Museum</strong><br>
      The Prado Museum, which commemorated its 200th anniversary in 2019, is the crown jewel of one of the city’s most popular tourist itineraries: the Paseo del Arte, where you'll also find the Thyssen-Bornemisza and Reina Sofía museums.
      The Prado's walls are lined with masterpieces from the Spanish, Italian and Flemish schools, including Velázquez’ Las Meninas and Goya’s Third of May, 1808.
      Its collection comprises 8,600 paintings and over 700 sculptures, so we recommend deciding what you want to see before stepping into the museum.
      If you are short on time, the Prado's website suggests three itineraries, lasting 1, 2 and 3 hours and covering the museum's most important masterpieces.

    <li  class="places"> <strong>The Plaza Mayor</strong> <br>
      The Plaza Mayor dates back to the 15th century where it was originally called the "Plaza del Arrabal" and was used as the main market of the town.
      In 1561, the plaza was transferred to the city of Madrid. King Philip II commissioned Classical architect Juan de Herrera to remodel the area.
      Construction did not begin until Philip III's reign in 1617.
      Juan Gómez de Mora continued on the architectural renovation, and was finished two years later in 1619. The Plaza Mayor has suffered 3 major fires in its history.
      The first was in 1631. Juan Gómez de Mora took on the reconstructions of the plaza following this fire.
      The second of the fires occurred in 1670, with the architect Tomás Román in charge of the reconstruction.
      The last fire consumed a third of the square and took place in 1790.
